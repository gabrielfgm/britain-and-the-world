# Reading Notes for Britain and the World Lecture

## Findlay and O'Rourke, *Power and Plenty*, Chapter 7, "The Great Specialization"

+ Beginning of great differentiation between a 'North' and 'South'
+ Notes the oddity of e.g. continental blockage: denying your enemy gold by denying yourself food
    * Implication is belief that Britain cannot finance a war on a trade deficit
+ In the short run, the war had a large impact on prices
+ In the long-run, the war stimulates some industries (e.g. beetroot sugar) that are viable only under protection
    * These industries then demand political special favors over the rest of the 19th and sometimes into the 20th century
+ Emphasizes the degree to which previous globalizations were *political* projects rather than technologically driven
+ Iterates through technological improvements including roads, steam shipping (interacting with Suez), and railroads
+ Fall in wheat prices is both Chicago-NYC and NYC-Liverpool phenomenon: bigger cost reduction in former in fact
+ Heckscher-Ohlin effects: convergence in the $wage/rental$ ratio
+ Then emphasizes imperialism as a driver of globalization
    * Very much including the USA
+ Then turns to trade policy. Openness often imposed on colonies (or at least openness to metropole)
    * Tendency toward european trade liberalization up to about 1870 followed by tendency toward protection
    * The US is pretty consistently protectionist
+ Big takeaway for trade policy:
    * In the UK, Asia and Africa technology and imperialism were both pushing costs down
    * In constrast, elsewhere technology and politics tended to work in opposite directions
+ UK support to maintain an open market (for free trade more generally) is in part underwritten by the large trade-surplus they are generating with Asia which allows them to run trade deficits with e.g. USA
+ Notes that factors (people and capital) flowed towards abundant land
    * Capital was *not* chasing cheap labor as we think about for the 20th century, it was chasing cheap land
+ For specialization and exchange, notes that US is something of an outlier
    * Not wholly true, re-industrialization is emerging at teh end of the period
    * Manuf. - Agric. does not easily map onto rich - poor as 'New World' often wealthier (had higher wages) but exports primary products
    * So specialization is *sort of true*, and quite true vis-a-vis e.g. Europe and Asia or LA
+ Did this system damage the 'Global South'?
    * On the one hand, potentially kills industrialization
    * On the other, raises incomes
    * Notes it probably depends on the binding resource constraints on labor allocation: with 'unlimited' supplies of labor should be straightforward
        - Lewis model

## Austin, 'Capitalism and the colonies'

+ Many posited links between capitalism and colonialism but above all: "colonial rule by capitalist countries has often been seen as the primary vehicle for the spread of capitalist institutions worldwide"
+ 5 features to the history of colonialism post-1850
    1. Happens in the context of *divergence* in wealth and military power
    2. IR generates historic transformation of Euro-Asian relations from Euro trade deficit to trade surplus
        + "Further, by enormously increasing the supply of manufactured goods, the British industrial revolution triggered a prolonged shift in the barter terms of trade worldwide in favor of primary producers": interesting point, had not fully considered. Combination of growing competition and greater incentives towards primary products is a spur to deindustrialization
    3. Nature of trading empire shifts: becomes more territorial. Tends to act more in the name of multilateral free trade rather than mercantilism
    4. No more settler colonies post 1850
    5. Old europe gets new rivals in neo-Europes (US, Canada, Australia, etc) & Japan
+ Marx thought imperialism was a method of expanding capitalism
    * Other Marxist scholars have argued that the form of capitalism that was exported was sub-standard
    * This strangely comports with some neo-classical accounts e.g. AJR on settler vs non-settler colonies (kind of -- they are positing a different mechanism)
+ Capitalism elements in imperial expansion key claim: 
    * "once industrialization was under way, the propensity of imperial powers to use force against foreigners overseas, either to make them open their markets or to seize their territory, was related to the unevenness of the spread of industrialization in time and space"
+ Claim rests on 5 elements
    1. Using force becomes less costly because of power-gap
    2. Least industrially advanced industrializers are most interested in territorial gains: Britain, Belgium, Germany not particularly interested in *formal* imperial control
    3. To clarify above, means that *manufacturers* are not invested in territorial expansion. Lobbyists are typically merchants.
    4. Capitalist classes of newly industrialized Western countries worried about calming proletarian discontent
    5. Imperialism often more driven by finance than manufacturing
+ On the colonies -> industrialization question
    * Williams thesis generally not supported
    * Inikori has tried to revive, in part by pointing to specific products as templates for innovation on the supply-side in Britain
    * Could also note demand-side explanations a la O'Rourke

## Tooze and Fertik, "The World Economy and the Great War"

+ Object is to endogenize WWI to the process of economic globalization in the 19th century that preceeded it.
+ Notes that it is causally weak to attribute WWI to 'a sniper's bullet' as opposed to broader structural forces
    * "The original point of the NBER school therefore was precisely to add further layers of over-determination to the crisis of globalization in the early twentieth-century. What underpinned the mounting level of trade integration before 1914 was no “London consensus” on free trade, but a supply side shock delivered by falling transport costs."
+ Suggests that in the background literature "tariffs and immigration restriction may be logically derived from teh consequences of globalization, but war is not."
+ Argues for *convergence* as a key driver of war
    * "Being converged upon by Imperial Russia was every bit as unsettling to the powers of Western Europe before 1914, as the rise of China is to the United States today."
+ This combines with financial and fiscal concerns
    * "The destabilizing implications of differential economic growth rates for the arms race were compounded by the leverage provided by access to international capital markets."
