## The shift: From  **Mercantilism** to **Free trade**

> "The prevailing mercantilist doctrine [of the 18th c.] ...viewed the struggle for wealth as a zero-sum game, and each of the powers looked upon its colonies as suppliers of raw materials and markets for manufactures of the 'mother country' alone, with foreign interlopers to be excluded by force if necessary. ...The aim was to exert monopoly control over a given trade, thus gaining monopoly profits, which in turn would increase the state's ability to successfully wage war, thus enhancing its mercantilist trade objectives."<br> -Findlay & O'Rourke, p. 228.


### Key factors in the emergence of a new 19th c. economic order

.large[
1. The industrial revolution
2. The defeat of Napoleon
3. The loss of colonies in the Americas

## The Industrial Revolution in Global Context

+ Applications of industrial technology reduce transport costs
+ Industrial technology heightens global inequalities of wealth/power
+ Industrial revolution reverses long-standing European-Asian trading pattern
    - Europe finally runs trade surpluses
    - Asian manufactures (e.g. Indian textiles) face growing competition
    - Terms-of-trade swing towards primary products prompting Asian de-industrialization (Austin, 302).

### The Defeat of Napoleon

+ Invasion of Russia key to defeat (Schroeder, 1994)
    + Disastrous loss of life
+ Weakening of Napoleon prompt's Prussian defection
+ Napoleonic intransigence scuttles Franco-Russian settlement mediated by Austria
+ Britain's role is mostly financing

## The Post-War Settlement: British Semi-Hegemony?

> Each of the two flanking powers commanded more intrinsic resources than any of the other three. ...Britain dominated the seas while leading the world in industry, commerce, colonies, and financial power ... each of these flanking powers enjoyed virtual impregnability by virtue of geography... Thus Britain and Russia were so powerful and invulnerable that even a (highly unlikely) alliance of the three other powers against them would not seriously threaten the basic security of either, while such a (hypothetical) alliance would likewise not give France, Austria, and Prussia security comparable to that which Britain or Russia enjoyed on their own. <br> -Schroeder, "Did the Vienna Settlement Rest on a Balance of Power?", p. 688

### Britain emerges as...

+ Strongest industrial power
    + Least economically crippled by war
+ Largest Navy by order of magnitude
+ Not directly threatened by only other large power (Russia)

### Did 19th c. globalization sow the seeds of its own destruction?

> "What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in August 1914! The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their delivery upon his doorstep ; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend.<br> -John Maynard Keynes, *The Economic Consequences of the Peace*, pp. 11
